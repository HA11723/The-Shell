Rabbits are small mammals known for their long ears, fluffy tails, and strong 
hind legs. They belong to the family Leporidae and are found in various habitats
worldwide, including meadows, forests, grasslands, and even deserts. Rabbits are
herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses, leaves, and vegetables. They are 
known for their reproductive capabilities, often producing multiple litters 
of offspring each year. In addition to being popular pets, rabbits play important 
roles in ecosystems as prey for many predators and as agents of seed dispersal. 
Their social behavior and burrowing habits make them fascinating creatures to observe. 
Have you ever had a pet rabbit or seen one in the wild?
