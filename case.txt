The recent court case involving Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student, 
has garnered significant attention. Khalil, who participated in pro-Palestinian 
demonstrations, was detained by federal immigration agents on March 8, 2025. His
lawyers are currently fighting to prevent his deportation, arguing that his 
detention is a targeted attempt to suppress constitutionally protected activism1
. The case is being heard in New Jersey, where a judge must first decide if the 
court has jurisdiction before addressing the legality of Khalils detention23.
